Math.round(value); // 13

// 2. Round the value up.

// 3. Round the value down.

// 4. Simulate a coin flip by generating a random number. Assume the coin is
//    fair and print the result, heads or tails, to the console.

// 2. Make a program that does the following: (1) Use a prompt to obtain the
//    birth year of the user. (2) Use a prompt to obtain the birth month of
//    the user. (3) Use a prompt to obtain the birth day of the user.
//    (4) Calculate how old the user is in days. (5) Show the result to
//    the user.
